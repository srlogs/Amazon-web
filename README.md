Hi,

This is Logeshwaran, and I have been assigned the project “Implement cart module of an e-commerce platform like Amazon”
Please find the GitHub repository link:
GITHUB LINK:

How to run the above project from GITHUB:
Clone the above repository.
Run “npm install” command to install the needed dependencies of this application.
Run “ng serve” to run this application.
	
While running the application, kindly update the product list in the Admin Portal first before logging into user portal, since only the products updated by the admin are visible to the users. 
Workflow of the project:
Admin Module:
Admin can access application by entering the respective credentials
Username: admin
Password: admin@ecom
Admin can add new item, update existing item quantity as well as discount value

Consumer Module: 
Consumer need to register into this application to access the products
After registration and successful login, users can do the following actions:
Buy the products
Can add the products to their cart
Can add the products to the wishlist

Note:
	Since web localstorage doesn't have enough memory (around 10MB) to store all the images, I stored the path of the images which lies in this path "amazon/src/assets".  Please choose images from "amazon/src/assets" in this project folder.
	 USERS CANNOT SEE ANY PRODUCTS IN THEIR ACCOUNT UNLESS ADMIN UPDATES THE PRODUCTS IN THE PORTAL FIRST
